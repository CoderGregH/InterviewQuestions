# Instructions

To be used for coding interviews where you want to see a candiate code live

- Small and simple so it can be absorbed easily
- To help a candiate show what they can do without preparing code offline
- To make sure we see candiate code rather than setting a task that is performed offline and presented to us.

We will have a few options for our default langauges

- C#
- Typescript
- Python (coming soon!)

# Pre Interview Setup

## CoderPad.io

- Simple to prepare and try out
- Just go to https://app.coderpad.io/sandbox and type away
- We will ask a candiates to share their screen

## Web Ex

- Instructions are sent out by HR
- But make sure you can **share your screen**

# Examples That Will Be Covered

Both of these will be covered

- Langauge of your choice
- Nice to see a variety of languages

## Coding Needing Refactoring

This is written deliberatly badly

The task for the candiate is refactor it and remove the code smells they find

Time given 20 mins

> We will not expect test to be written, but don't let that stop you if you find that helps you

## Coding Needing Testing

Code that has no unit tests which we want to be coveraged

The task for the candiate is to

- For the Existing Code add tests in a methodical manor
- For the new code block write tests in a test driven manor to implement a simple piece of business logic

## Is there a right answer?

No its to simply to see that canidate can

- Code
- Refactor and write units tests in real time
- Ask questions as they go along
- Prepare inadvance
