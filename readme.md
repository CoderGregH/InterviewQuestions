# Instructions

To be used for living coding interviews

- Simple to absorb
- To help a candiate show what they can do without preparing code offline
- To make sure we see candiate code

## CoderPad.io

- Simple to prepare for

## Start Code

We will have a few options

This is written badly deliberatly

The task for the candiate is refactor it and remove the code smells they find

## Coding Needing Testing

Code that has no unit tests which we want to be coveraged

The task for the candiate is to

- Add tests in a methodical manor to the exising code
- write tests in a test driven was to implement a simple piece of business logic

## Is there a right answer?

No its to simply to see that canidate can
